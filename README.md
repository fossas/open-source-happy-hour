# Open Source Happy Hour
Open Source Happy Hour is a fun, casual evening where we invite interesting Open-Sourcerers to meet, drink and talk about Open Source.

[FOSSA](https://fossa.io) hosts these from time to time in our San Francisco office, but we want **you** to host one in every city! In this repo, we will share resources and gather feedback to help you host a FOSSA Happy Hour.

## Format
These are casual events, so feel free to mix it up!  At FOSSA, we typically lead with a featured guest of honor, series of lightning talks, and plenty of time to drink and hang out.

## Hosting your Own
We want to support you in hosting your own OSS Happy Hour!

 1. Create a Github Issue on this repo
 2. When approved, send a PR to add details about your event to the README
 3. Share feedback and eventually commit tips to these docs
 
When hosting an event, FOSSA will help you plan and cover some of the budget / bar tab. In exchange, we want you to make sure it's a great time!  

In your issue, please provide some details:

 1. Where and when do you want to host your Happy Data Hour?
 2. How many people do you expect to join you? 
 3. What are some awesome local companies or open source developers you want to feature?
 4. What channels are you planning on promoting the event on?
 5. Are there local organizations that would be interested in sponsoring?
 
To help make this event great and future events even better, make sure to collect feedback, take pictures and share your post-event thoughts in this repo / on social media.
